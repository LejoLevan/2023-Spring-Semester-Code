Welcome to the "Learning Systems Programming with C" repository! This README showcases my educational journey in mastering Systems Programming with C during a university class.

## Introduction
This repository documents my experiences and progress in understanding Systems Programming, with a particular focus on the C programming language. Throughout the university course, we explored low-level programming concepts, operating system interactions, and practical applications of C in system-level development.

## University Course Overview
### Course Objectives
The primary objective of the course was to provide us with a deep understanding of Systems Programming principles and how to apply them using C. The key learning objectives included:

- Familiarity with low-level programming concepts and machine architecture.
- Proficiency in C programming and its memory management features.
- Understanding operating system interactions and system calls.
- Developing efficient and robust system-level applications.
### Learning Approach
The class followed a combination of theoretical lectures, hands-on coding sessions, and challenging assignments. We were encouraged to explore real-world scenarios and solve practical problems typical in Systems Programming.

## Topics Covered
### C Programming
The course began with a comprehensive review of the C programming language, covering essential topics such as:

- Pointers and Memory Management
- Arrays and Strings
- File Handling
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Preprocessor Directives
We delved deep into C's capabilities, understanding its role as a powerful language for Systems Programming.

### System Calls and Interactions
We explored the interactions between C programs and the underlying operating system through system calls. Topics covered included:

- File I/O and File Descriptors
- Process Management with Forks
- Interprocess Communication using Pipes
- Multithreading and Thread Synchronization
- Understanding these concepts allowed us to build complex applications that interacted efficiently with the operating system.

### Memory Management and Performance
Memory management and performance optimization were key areas of focus. We learned about:

- Memory Mapping
- Virtual Memory and Paging
- Buffering and Caching
These topics were crucial in developing applications with optimal resource utilization.

## Projects and Assignments
Throughout the course, we worked on various projects and assignments that applied our knowledge of Systems Programming in practical scenarios. Some of the projects included:

- Implementing fork, pipe, and file handling techniques to achieve parallel processing.
- Developing a chat software using threads and/or pipes for handling multiple clients simultaneously.
- Creating aserver that utilizes multithreading to handle multiple incoming client requests efficiently.
## Conclusion
The university class on "Systems Programming with C" has been a challenging and rewarding experience. I now possess a solid foundation in low-level programming, C language, and interactions with the operating system.

The knowledge gained during this course has opened up exciting opportunities for me to explore the world of Systems Programming and contribute to the development of efficient and robust system-level software.
